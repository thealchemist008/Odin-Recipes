Odin HTML Project: Recipes
The very first HTML Project for The Odin Project Curriculum.
The goal of this project is to be able to build a simple website 
centered around the idea of "Recipes" using basic HTML elements.

I was able to build my very first website with the help of
The Odin Project! It was fun being able to see my website run after
a few hours of coding it. I was able to use all the HTML elements
that was taught in the curriculum especially the ordered and unordered lists.
